## English
The Siemens S7 adapter is based on Snap7, with Snap7 when the
S7 adapter is also installed, and the actual S7 communication between ioBroker and the S7 is organized via TCP / IP.

It is therefore necessary that the S7 has an Ethernet interface
(integrated in the CPU or as a separate CP) and can communicate via TCP / IP with the hardware on which ioBroker is running.

It is assumed that the user has the necessary knowledge of TCP / IP communication
and is able to configure and program the S7 accordingly using Step7.
Proficient use of a PC and various operating systems is also a prerequisite.
These requirements are certainly not a challenge for someone
who is considering communication between ioBroker and an S7.

The format of the addresses for Inputs, Outputs or markers is "X.Y", where X is byte offset and Y is the bit offset in the byte.
The format of the addresses for DBs is `DBZ +X.Y`, where `z` is number of `DB`, like `DB34 +12.0`

### Installation
On some Linux systems, the build essentials must be installed to get this adapter work. You can install it with:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

Under windows is Visual Studio 2013 (Community Edition is enough) or later is required to get it running.
Python 2.x is required too. Not 3.x.

## Time offset
You can use 4 time offset modes for S7TIME:
- Local: the time value will be not modified
- UTC: local time offset will be added to received time. E.g., for Germany: -60 Minutes in winter and -120 Minutes in summer.
- Set offset (use summer/winter): Given offset in minutes will be subtracted from received time and in summer additionally, 60 minutes will be subtracted.
- Set offset (no summer/winter): Just the given offset in minutes will be subtracted from received time. No matter in winter or in summer.

## S5TIME
S5 decoded as described here: http://www.plccenter.cn/Siemens_Step7/Format_des_Datentyps_S5TIME_Zeitdauer.htm

## Tia Portal
To use ioBroker with Tia Portal, ou need to disable the optimisation of blocks:

Right-click on the data block and then on 'Properties'. Under attributes, you will find the option "Optimized block access". Take off the hook.
After recompiling, the addresses are displayed in the data block ("Offset" column). 

You can read about it [here](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.s7/issues/113) too.
